            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why I Want to Depart</h1><h2>Thoughts, fears, and why I decided it’s time to leave.</h2><p>I love my country. I hope all my fears are imagined, my concerns are exaggerated, and my grievances are fast and easily remedied. I love my home state of Michigan. I’m a mid-westerner to my core. I love fishing, hunting, hiking, and boating. I wrestled for one year in high-school; I lost every match but still enjoyed the season. I served for five years with the United States Army — seeing three tours of duty: two in Afghanistan and one in Iraq before I returned to civilian life. I went to Infantry school, Airborne school, and Psyop school. I was on, I don’t even know, more than a hundred missions certainly. I saw direct enemy fire on some occasions. I lost friends and comrades in arms on missions. I think I feared for my own life most days.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b87ab8f8-4e78-4ad6-9d1a-7e5fa5f1707e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Making HP-LED Light Systems]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Making HP-LED Light Systems</h1><p>A little less than two years ago I began studying the methods available to use high power LED modules for home lighting solutions. Since then I designed and tested a number of prototypes; finding a preferred circuit, I am now prototyping and testing this circuit in order to hone the design. At this point the project is still quite immature, but I have been building functional lighting solutions for some time now; they are not prohibitively expensive, and they have been working well so far. This post is my review of the results. Finally, before we get to the lights, I want to apologize ahead of time because some sections below are not thoroughly documented. I hope to flesh everything out eventually, but until then some sections are quite underdeveloped.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1f7251c5-8b60-4dee-b882-5eb4afc27654.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Work & Play</h1><p>I am a computer programmer from West Michigan. Lately I am working with website design and development, and I am really enjoying getting familiar with the Node.js “non-frameworky framework” Ampersand. The growth in the Node.js eco-system is truly incredible to behold these days. It’s just awesome to be alive in 2016 programming with node. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7efedc59-1fee-4a05-a0c6-a716002ca618.jpg"></article>]]></description>
