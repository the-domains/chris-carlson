I am a computer programmer from West Michigan. Lately I am working with website design and development, and I am really enjoying getting familiar with the Node.js "non-frameworky framework" [Ampersand][0]. The growth in the Node.js eco-system is truly incredible to behold these days. It's just awesome to be alive in 2016 programming with node.

Eventually, when I have the resources necessary to support the development, I want to start building stand-alone web applications. I've been contemplating a few in particular for a long time now, and I'm burning to start working on them.

# Electronics Hobbyist

I've been experimenting with micro-controllers, relays, and sensors for a couple years, and I've been studying and prototyping High Power LED lighting circuits and ballasts for about two. In other words, I'm still a hobbyist, but now when I look at a circuit diagram I don't spend the first few minutes feeling overwhelmed and scared; I consider this a great improvement.

You can read about the LED Light projects on my [High Power LED Designs page][1].

# Small Business Owner

I am also the owner of a small business,[Carlson Technical Advising][2], that officially opened earlier this year. At that time I was the only employee. Now we are a three person team, a coder, a designer, and a salesman.
