# Military Service

In 2007 I joined the Army, and that is where I spent the next 5 years of my life.   
I served on three tours of duty - two in Afghanistan and one in Iraq, and I had the opportunity to work with some of the finest men and women our nation has.   
In the army I learned to read, write, and speak Arabic, I was taught how to jump out of airplanes, and I learned how to find my way through the woods at night. Among other things, I still miss the camaraderie and the sense of common purpose that exists among soldiers.

Afghanistan made a lasting impression on me. It was unlike anywhere I had ever been in the world. It could be strikingly beautiful, but it was also rugged and austere. I sometimes find myself longing to see it again.
