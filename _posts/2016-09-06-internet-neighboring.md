![Just a matter of time 'til it's the norm](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/076a5f2f-b88c-47ac-b7d3-9f3650906437.jpg)

Fifteen years ago people were wary about online dating. They voiced their concerns frequently and publicly, warning about the dangers of meeting, in real life, people who one had found on the internet...

"You never know who might be sitting on the other side of your computer screen ", they warned; wondering rhetorically, "Besides, why would you want to pick the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with from the Internet?"

Five years later Internet dating was becoming the norm. Proponents of the practice joked at the early detractor's expense, "Yeah, why would you want to learn about a person you're considering going out with, when you can just find a random stranger at your local bar and hope for the best?"

And everyone agreed. It made good sense, and was incredibly helpful, to know about a person's interests and values before becoming romantically involved with them.

These days, when I introduce the idea of using the Internet to find a neighborhood or community to live in, people often react the same way many reacted to internet dating. They appear to become uneasy, and they cast about for some reason to explain why it probably wont work. Now even wondering rhetorically, "Besides, why would you want to choose where you're going to live based on some people on the Internet?"

In about five years, Internet neighboring will be becoming the norm, and people will joke at the early detractor's expense, "Yeah, why would you use the Internet to find neighbors you like, when you could just as easily never consider it at all, and end up with whatever neighbors happen to be living there?"
