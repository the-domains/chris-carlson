# Systemback: A Sweet Linux System Backup Utility

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3b22dc8c16c435dd2cc0702c3e8bc8a39c391c58.png" /><h1>Systemback in Launchpad</h1><p>Systemback makes it easy to create backups of the system and the users configuration files. In case of problems you can easily restore the previous state of the system. There are extra features like system copying, system installation and Live system creation.</p></article>

This week I decided my old system backup scripts weren't cutting it any more, and I went on a hunt for something new. I found Systemback and it is glorious.

I had been using RSync for backups; I had put together a few simple bash scripts to ease the process, but it wasn't an ideal solution. The scrips were a bit unwieldy, and they were not easy to reconfigure. I was going to do a wipe and reinstall on a development box this week, and I decided to see if any new utilities were available before fiddling with the RSync scripts too much. It turns out there was a new utility available, and now that I've used it a few times I can say definitively: It's Brilliant!

System restore points can be made and restored to easily, which is great, really all I needed, but it offers a lot more too. It can create a live usb from your system too! The interface is simple, it took me less than an hour to understand how to use it, and the operation is smooth and trouble free.
