# Marriage to Vanessa

My wife and I knew each other from Michigan, her brother and I were friends for years, but I only knew Vanessa personally for about 8 days before she disappeared from my life again for four more years. When we first met, she was eighteen years old, and she had recently enlisted in the army. She was due to ship out in 8 days.

I couldn't understand why she was doing that, and I considered trying to talk her out of it; then I blinked and she was already gone. I felt a little heartsick to see her go - I did not consider myself a good fit for the military lifestyle really, I didn't imagine I would ever join, so I doubted I would ever see her again.

Around three years later I was getting ready to leave for boot camp myself. I don't know when I got to wondering about searching for Vanessa on the army website, but I do recall that the instant I realized I was able to query an army wide database for contact information, I looked up Vanessa in there and wrote her an email. We were eventually married in 2011\.
