# Cloud Storage that is Distributed, Encrypted, Cheap

## What else is there?

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c3791e8efb51fba2ece5aa9d1d1804e5fe7f37c.jpg" /><h1>Storj - Decentralized Cloud Storage</h1><p>Distributed, encrypted, and blazing fast object storage, where only you have access to your data.</p></article>

I learned about and tested out Storj this week, and it's great. I haven't used it much, I just installed it and tried uploading and downloading a file, but everything worked perfectly. I haven't heard of anything else that offers the same level of security that storj does. It is darn cheap too. I'll be integrating it into my workflow in the weeks to come. More updates will follow.
