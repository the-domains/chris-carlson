# Why I Want to Depart

## Thoughts, fears, and why I decided it's time to leave.

I love my country. I hope all my fears are imagined, my concerns are exaggerated, and my grievances are fast and easily remedied. I love my home state of Michigan. I'm a mid-westerner to my core. I love fishing, hunting, hiking, and boating. I wrestled for one year in high-school; I lost every match but still enjoyed the season. I served for five years with the United States Army --- seeing three tours of duty: two in Afghanistan and one in Iraq before I returned to civilian life. I went to Infantry school, Airborne school, and Psyop school. I was on, I don't even know, more than a hundred missions certainly. I saw direct enemy fire on some occasions. I lost friends and comrades in arms on missions. I think I feared for my own life most days.

I always had reason enough to stay here. There was enough to love about this place that, no matter how great other places might sound, I never really wanted to leave. It is disconcerting now to settle in to this new perspective.

### Idealism

I took my oath to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America to heart. I nursed idealistic notions about what our nation stands for; that it was a true democracy run by the people and for the people. That the Bill of Rights was held on high, ensuring all people were guaranteed, as a minimum standard these inalienable rights: That they would have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to peaceably assemble, freedom of the press; That they would be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizure, that these things would not be deprived of them except by due process of law; That they would receive a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury, that they would not endure cruel or unusual punishments, that neither bail nor fines would be excessive.

I was naive, I suppose, in also believing that our nation held dear the declaration of independence; Particularly the leading sentence of the second paragraph,

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

I was idealistic enough, or maybe just so enamored of the Declaration of Independence, that I believed it served as a kind of national spiritual-guide for lawmaking; useful in times when the constitution was a little fuzzy about what to do. This was, I imagined, why we celebrated the 4th of July at all: because we had committed ourselves as a nation to strive for high ideals. That our government's primary and core function was to, "secure these rights", of life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for its citizens.

### Disabused

As time passed, reality began poking holes in my idealistic notions. One by one the principles I held dear, the ones this nation was founded upon, disappeared like spectres in daylight. Where each of them had once been, if anything remained at all, there was left only a facade. A sort of mirage, designed, it appeared, to quiet the consciences of hard working, tax paying citizens; citizens who could vote to set things straight---if only they noticed.

The first piece of the puzzle, something that confused me for years, was the arbitrary criminalization of various herbal, chemical, and pharmaceutical substances in the United States. I couldn't understand how they made the distinction. Why did the possession of some substances carry long mandatory sentences while other equally potent, addictive, and potentially harmful substances did not?

For example, why the sentencing discrepancies between _crack-cocaine and powder-cocaine?_ Why the harsh criminalization of _cannabis _but legal prescription of o_piate-based pain killers(morphine, oxy-contin, etc..._)? Why the vilification of _Meth-Amphetamine_ but the legal and widespread prescription of _Meth's sister-drugs Dextro-Amphetamine and Levo-Amphetamine (and t_o our nations children no less)? (_Dextro-Amphetamine and Levo-Amphetamine _are the main ingredients of_Adderall_---Recently FDA approved for use in children as young as 3 years old if I'm not mistaken). These questions nagged at me for years, but until I had the next piece of the puzzle it remained a mystery.

Then I learned that, throughout the United States, large corporations and businesses get cheap/near-free labor from prisoners. Not surprisingly, a lot of money can be made on prisoners. Realising that large corporations are getting near free labor made something click. I read further into the situation and became acquainted with what is frequently called, "The Prison-Industrial complex".

It turns out that the cheap labor corporations get is really just a small piece of the pie, because all around there is just a killing to be made on keeping folks in cages. You can make money building the facilities. You can make money running them. You can make money working at the facilities. You can make money providing food services and laundry services to the facilities. And, maybe the best part of all is, (if you own the facility anyway), you can decide who gets the food contracts, who gets the cheap labor contracts, who gets the laundry contracts, and for every one of these lucrative contracts you can almost certainly finagle some spectacular off the books gifts from companies competing to get a job contract, (in short, there are lucrative 'kickbacks').

So how many prisoners do we have? The ugly truth is, The United States has more prisoners than any other nation in the world by far. Recent estimates put the US Prison Population at around 2.2 million. It's laughable to compare our imprisonment rate to other western nations. The only country that even approaches our numbers is, you guessed it, The Peoples Republic of China which has nearly four times the population of ours, yet they have merely 1.6 million prisoners. Yeah. Seems pretty fishy doesn't it?

Well it isn't fishy. It makes sense. There's money to be made putting people in jail. All a jailor ever needs is a _publicly_ acceptable reason to put folks away, from there on in it's all greased lighnight. What really is the "The Drug War"? I'm almost afraid to know. 

How do you enslave millions without anyone noticing? You label them "Addicts"_, _frame them as a "Criminal Menace", a "Danger to themselves and to society". Playing it smart, you pick a drug that mostly poor people use, or one that is favored by minorities. (This is because poor people can't mount much of a legal defence, and minorities are more easily marginalised and demonised---their complaints will fall on deaf ears.)

Well then, what kinds of chemicals fit the bill? First it's important that the herb or chemical is inexpensive and relatively easy to manufacture. This is because poor people can't afford to manufacture expensive complicated drugs on their own, duh --- they're poor. Secondly, it has to be something that a lot of people like, something generally effective, or something highly addictive. Finally, it is ideal if the drug is preferred by, or specific to, a minority group, (again because they're the least able to mount a legal defence and they have the least social resources available to them.).

How about, Cannabis? Its cheap and easy to grow, most everybody likes it, and, (as was reportedly the case when marijuana laws were enacted), it is preferred by a minority group. Check. Make it illegal.

Okay, how about Crack? It's also cheap and easy to make, it's extremely addictive---even though not a lot of people like it, if we get enough to try it they'll get hooked. Bonus, it's also specific to a minority group. Rich people use the powder, not the rock, so no worries there either. Check. Make it illegal.

Lastly, what about Meth-Amphetamine? It is cheap and easy to make. It was sold over the counter in this country for many years, and most everyone who tries it likes. These days anyone with money buys something nicer - any number of improved pharmaceutical grade amphetamines. Perfect. Make it illegal.

AND POOF! GONE! Notions about _life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness just flew right out th_e Window!

Notions about _excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel or unusual punishments _are GONE! POOF! They cease to exist except as a facade.

Even notions about _the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable search and seizure_ are suddenly on shaky ground. It's no matter, these were soon to fall anyway.

The right to privacy, as you already know unless you live in a cave, is long gone. That great American Hero, Mr. Edward Snowden, made us all aware of this fact. If you're not aware of this, and you doubt this fact in the least, look into NSA surveillance of US citizens, (keep in mind this was just one way they managed it. Another method of circumventing domestic surveillance regulations is using something akin to The Five Eyes Agreement to share intelligence among spy agencies. This might sound like an okay deal at first glance, but unfortunately it falls flat when you consider the types of people who become spies... they aren't typically the most honest or trustworthy folks. Allegations of collusion and collaboration among various intelligence organisations are many and convincing.

The scheme is simple. New Zealand intelligence agencies, for example, aren't allowed to spy on their own citizens, but sometimes they really want to spy on them. What do they do? Naturally they ask their spy buddies in the US, Canadian, Australian or British intelligence agencies to do the spying for them. If or when their pals find anything interesting out, they pass that information back. Folks in the intelligence game are a tight knit club. They're always willing to return the favor.

POOF! GONE! The right of the people to be secure in their persons, their homes, their papers, and their effects is no more.

Freedom of the Press? Nope. Look into the journalists trying to report on the Keystone XL pipelines. Look into "Close-Hold Embargo" practices by the FDA. Look into the reporting on the Waco Massacre.

What about Freedom of Religion? Gone too. Ever really research what happened at Waco? Surprise, that's a religious group that was getting a little too powerful. They were burned alive in their homes. There were seventy-six dead in total. Twenty-two of them were Children, thirty-two of them were women (two of whom were pregnant), and twenty were men.

Just imagine, fifty-six women, children, and unborn babies killed. At least Five children shot. Most of the remaining women and children are suspected to have died of acute cyanide poisoning, causing their muscles to contract so hard their necks probably snapped. Anyone who survived the cyanide was burned alive inside their homes save a handful of burned and battered poor souls. Following the massacre, the whole house and the entire crime scene was bull-dozed and destroyed. Journalists were not allowed to observe any of what went on for the fifty-one days long siege. Evidence suggests military psychological warfare methods were employed. This is one area my expertise lends an insider's perspective and I have no doubt: The methods used were Psychological Warfare Techniques. They were taught, in principle if not specifically, at the US Army Psychological Operations Training Course, in Fort Bragg, NC--- when I attended the course anyway.

To tie this whole dirty affair up neatly the media fell into line. They painted the Branch Dividians as a devilish cult that had tragically fallen under the spell of their charismatic leader, "David Koresh". They plastered screens with allegations that Koresh was a pedophile, that he was taking advantage of the young women and girls, despite a significant lack of substantiating evidence. In a fashion not unlike the recent sudden appearance of women complaints against Trump, a girl or two were found who were willing to make statements that Koresh was a pedophile. Were the women offered something to complain against Trump? I can't say. Were the girls promised anything to call David a pedophile? I don't know. I can only be sure about a few simple facts.

On one side is a group, completely isolated from contact with the outside world for a fifty-one days long siege. This group made desperate requests to speak to journalists, but their requests were denied. Their pleas went unheard, and they were ultimately silenced for good. Even the evidence of what happened was destroyed by the same government organisations that murdered them. This side, in short, tried to call out for help, they tried to tell their side of the story, to reach out to the american public for support, but their voices were silenced. They would never get a chance to plead their case before a judge or before the american public.

On the other side are the official organizations. These organisations did everything in their power to prevent the Dividians from appealing to the public. They managed the information environment meticulously, expertly. Had this been a military operation, (and the official story is that it wasn't), I might even be impressed with their work. They clearly understood the risks, they took effective and incontrovertible measures to dominate the information environment, they expertly managed the media coverage - consistently and relentlessly presenting a polarising and harshly negative view of their opponents in every major media organisation. Despite all this, it eventually came to to light that the story they told consisted of misinformation, half truths, and even lies.

Is there any doubt that a cover up took place? Is there any question that the Davidians were murdered, massacred even? Did the media tell a story about a man under investigation for arms trafficing? Did they ever mention that even the warrent had expired prior to the raid? Is that how the public was sold the story? No. The media focused on his religous beliefs. The media portrayed him as a dangerous cult leader. Is there any doubt that the media was hand fed their story? The media followed orders, and sold the public a toxic mixture of misinformation, slander, speculation and lies. The Branch Dividians were tried in the court of public oppinion; they were presented as a bizzare religous group, and they were found guilty. The american people accepted their deaths as just precisely because of their religious beliefs. You believe in freedom of religion? Please, shake the sand our of your ears and look around. You believe in a free press? Don't bore me with your stupidity. If the government turns against you, the spectre of these rights will fast disappear too.

Freedom to Peaceable Assemble? Yeah, do it where you're told to, or get tear-gassed and fire-hosed.

Speedy Trial? Hah! Look into Brendan Dassey's troubles, or really anyone exonerated of a wrongful conviction. Getting into prison sure can be fast, but see how long it takes them to set you free when if exonerated.

Public Trial? Nope. Look into FISA courts to understand why even this simple right has been wholely abridged, (you may not sleep so well if you look into this one. Just hope you never get a letter from them.).

Is there anything left? I'm not sure at this point, but in honesty I had been aware of most of these things for quite some time now. I was not yet inclined to leave, despite suspecting many of these things were true. I remained optimistic that I might somehow make a change for the better. Perhaps, I thought, I can help restore some of these great principles to my town, my state, or even my country. But I learned something in the past few days that I too much to take.

I listened to an interview of our 19th secretary of defence, Dr. William Perry, he served un President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1997\. During his career he was an engineer and a mathematician, and he played a significant role developing the US Nuclear Arsenal. For this interview, (on the HBO Documentary News Series VICE, season 4 episode 14), he discussed the latest advances of the US nuclear arsenal.

As it turns out, the government of the United States of America has been at work developing some new nuclear weapons; these new nukes have a _smaller _blast radius and a much improved accuracy. The former Defence Secretary points out, that at first it would seem like a good idea to develop nuclear weapons with a smaller blast radius. This is not correct though, he argues, it actually leads to a very dangerous situation. The problem is, he says, _"They lead us into believing we can use nuclear weapons at lower levels of danger that would not lead to a full scale attack against the united states, that would not lead to a full scale nuclear war. That is a very very dangerous assumption." _Obviously dangerous, because if you're wrong, then maybe everyone on your continent, maybe the entire planet, gets killed. Whoops, shit!

No surprise that many other nations of the world don't like us upgrading our nuclear arsenal either. I was under the naive impression that we were working toward disarmament, not building more newer nukes, and certainly not straining world relations to the extent we could be headed toward another cold war---or worse a war with smaller more accurate nuclear weapons.

The other quote of Dr. Perry's that I will recount is his response to the question: "Are we living in dangerous nuclear times?"

He replies, "I believe that the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe today is greater than it was during the cold war, and our public is blissfully unaware of that."

Also relevant to this discussion is something I had heard mentioned in the news, that Russia refused to attend President Obama's Nuclear Powers Summit this year in 2016\. I had carelessly assumed this was due to Putin being offended about something unrelated, maybe the Ukraine, or maybe Putin was just feeling grumpy. My naivete knows no bounds it seems.

Of course I was wrong, Putin is apparently also concerned about the United States building modern Nukes. So much so that he did not attend the 2016 Nuclear Powers summit in protest. He has also, it turns out, allocated significant resources to modernising the Russian Nuclear Weapons stockpile in order to maintain parity with the government of the United States of America. Apparently, as far as I can tell, this effort has been successful, and they are already rolling out better more effective nuclear weapons of their own.

Well folks, I refuse to be a party to the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. I won't stay a day longer than I have to in a country so careless and foolish that it will risk reigniting a global nuclear arms race. I won't spend a day more than I must, in passive support of such foolishness. Apparently the government of this nation it is willing to risk the lives of its citizens, the lives of all of humanity itself, and simply to gain more power. (That is what nukes are all about after all: Power. If you have them, you're in power. If you don't have them, you have no bargaining ability at all. The boys with the bombs will just walk all over you. Think of Iran for example. Why do they want to have a Nuke? It's not so they can bomb Israel you dummy---Israel has enough Nukes to turn Iran into a GLASS desert. Firing a Nuke at Israel is a death sentence for Iran; even the Ayatollah wouldn't seriously consider it. The reason they want one is because then they wouldn't be so easy to step on. They would have some power, and they would would have some leeway to bargain.)

Back to the point. Our government is off the rails crazy, mad, for power. They do not have a problem with enslaving the poor and minorities of their own nation. They don't have a problem with burning 56 women and children alive and covering the whole thing up. They do not have a problem lying to you. They do not have a problem with Hillary Rodham Clinton manipulating the Democratic National Party primary election to get nominated - no matter how many voters were silenced. They don't have a problem with risking the lives of all the people of the nation, of all the people on earth, if they might gain a bit more power and control by doing it. They no longer want what is best for you, or your kids, or your family. The people with the reigns of this once great nation can not be trusted to keep my family safe, and this is why I must depart. If only I can, I will.

## I hope to find a place with our more peaceful neighbours to the North.

I really like the looks of Nova Scotia. I have heard a lot of great things about it, and the scenery is downright gorgeous, but I'm open to suggestions.

If anyone out there sees this, well if you're outside the states anyway, let me know where you recommend. If you know some place a moderately skilled programmer could find a job, please give me a introduction. I would sure love to be somewhere with a more reasonable government before the new year begins.

Thanks for reading,
