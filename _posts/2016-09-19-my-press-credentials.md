# My Press Credentials

I found the Constitution First Amendment Press Association's website this week, and I love what they're doing there. I took the [Constitutional Journalists Pledge][0], read and agreed to their Terms of Service, and I am now a credentialed member of the press.

I was looking into press credentials in the first place because I was doing some investigative journalism research. I was looking into a tip I had received, and I was finding more than a few references supporting what I had heard. I started to wonder if I might need Press Credentials to investigate further.

Although I probably didn't need them to continue the investigation, it doesn't hurt to have Press Credentials. Plus, I liked the [Constitutional Journalists Pledge][1]; I liked the idea of setting a high standard for myself about what I report on, and the C.J. Pledge requires exactly that.

_For anyone interested in having his or her own Press Credentials from the CFAPA, you can do so at[their website][2] for free. They only require that you take the pledge, and that you agree to their terms of service._
